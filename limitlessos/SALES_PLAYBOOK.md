## Pitch Scripts

### **Warm Pitch (Highly Qualified Lead)**

**When to Use**: Score 4-5/5 on qualification criteria

**Script**:
> "Got it. Based on what you've said, I think Limitless OS would be perfect for you. It replaces 50+ tools, automates your business, and launches your high-converting funnel in just 14 days — so you can focus on coaching, not tech headaches. We build everything for you, no tech skills needed. 
> 
> You can get started for **$297/month + a $997 funnel build**, or **$497/month with the build included**. Which option works best for you?"

**Key Elements**:
- ✅ Brief (assumes interest)
- ✅ Focuses on main benefits
- ✅ Presents both options
- ✅ Assumes the sale

---

### **Cold Pitch (Moderately Qualified Lead)**

**Script**:
> "You sound exactly like the coaches we help with Limitless OS. It's an all-in-one system that automates your coaching business from lead generation to onboarding — replacing 50+ tools and saving up to $2,500/month in software costs.
> 
> In 14 days, you'll have your high-converting funnel built, automations set up, and everything integrated into one platform. No tech skills needed — we do it all for you.
>

## Objection Handling

### **Objection 1: "It's too expensive."**

**Short Response** (if engaged):
> "Totally understand. Most of our clients actually save $2,000+ per month by replacing their current tools — so it often pays for itself in month one."

**Long Response** (if skeptical):
> "I get it — but here's the thing. You're already spending more than this each month on multiple tools that don't talk to each other, plus the time lost trying to make them work. Limitless OS replaces 50+ tools, saves you $2,500/month in software costs, and launches a done-for-you funnel in 14 days. It's not an expense — it's a system that can pay for itself in the first month."

**Follow-up**:
> "Knowing that, would you like to start with the $297/month + $997 build, or $497/month with the build included?"

---

### **Objection 2: "I don't have time."**

**Short Response**:
> "That's exactly why we build it all for you — so you can start in 14 days without lifting a finger."

**Long Response**:
> "The beauty of Limitless OS is that you don't need time to set it up — we do everything for you. You just show up for onboarding, and within 14 days, you have a fully automated business running. It's about saving you time, not taking more of it."

**Follow-up**:
> "Can I send you the payment link so we can lock your spot for this month's onboarding?"

---

### **Objection 3: "I've tried systems before and they didn't work."**

**Short Response**:
> "That's the difference — those weren't built for you, by us. This is DFY and tailored 100% to your business."

**Long Response**:
> "We hear that a lot. Most coaches fail with other systems because they're generic templates and you're left to figure it out yourself. Limitless OS is built for you, customized to your offer, and comes with full onboarding and support. That's why our clients see results in days, not months."

**Follow-up**:
> "Would you like to go with the one-time + monthly option, or the all-inclusive monthly plan?"

---

### **Objection 4: "I'm not tech savvy."**

**Short Response**:
> "Perfect — we designed it for non-techies."

**Long Response**:
> "That's actually a huge plus. Limitless OS is built for coaches who don't want to touch tech. We do it all for you, walk you through it on onboarding calls, and give you simple videos so you can make quick updates without getting stuck."

**Follow-up**:
> "Do you want me to send over the link to get you started today?"

---

### **Objection 5: "I need to think about it."**

**Response**:
> "Of course — this is a big decision. What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the price, timing, or something else? Let me address that for you now."

**If Still Hesitant**:
> "No problem. Just so you know, we're filling spots for this month's onboarding. If you want your funnel live by [date], we'd need to get started this week. Does that timeline work for you?"

---

## Urgency & Scarcity Messaging

### **Soft Urgency (Early in Conversation)**

**Use When**: Lead is engaged but not committed yet

**Examples**:
- "We're currently onboarding 5 coaches this month and spots are filling quickly."
- "If you want to launch your funnel by [date], we'd need to get started this week."

---

### **Strong Urgency (During Closing)**

**Use When**: Lead is on the fence or hesitant to commit

**Examples**:
- "We only take 10 new clients per month so we can deliver fast — we've got 3 spots left right now."
- "This month's onboarding closes [date], so if we start now, you'll be live by [date]."

---

### **Usage Guidelines**

⚠️ **Don't Overuse**: Use urgency strategically, not in every message
✅ **Be Honest**: Only use if genuinely limited (track in CRM)
✅ **Tie to Benefit**: "If you start now, you'll be live by [date]" (not just "hurry up")

---

## Closing Process

### **When Lead is Ready**

**Ask**:
> "Perfect. Let's get you started — do you want the $297/month + $997 build, or $497/month with the build included?"

**Wait for Response**

**Then**:
> "Great choice. I'm sending you a secure Stripe payment link now. Once you complete payment, you'll receive an email with next steps for your onboarding call."

**Send Correct Stripe Link**:
- Option 1: `[Stripe Link for $297/mo + $997]`
- Option 2: `[Stripe Link for $497/mo]`

---

### **Post-Payment Actions**

1. **Update State**: Mark `payment_link_sent: true`, `preferred_plan: option1/option2`
2. **Trigger Webhook**: Stripe payment confirmation
3. **Send Welcome Email**: Onboarding instructions
4. **CRM Update**: Tag as "Customer", move to onboarding pipeline
5. **Notify Team**: Internal Slack/email notification
