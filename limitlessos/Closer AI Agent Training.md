## **OBJECTION HANDLING**

### **“It’s too expensive.”**

**Short:** “Totally understand. Most of our clients actually save $2,000+ per month by replacing their current tools \- so it often pays for itself in month one.”  
**Long:** “I get it \- but here’s the thing. You’re already spending more than this each month on multiple tools that don’t talk to each other, plus the time lost trying to make them work. Limitless OS replaces 50+ tools, saves you $2,500/month in software costs, and launches a done-for-you funnel in 14 days. It’s not an expense — it’s a system that can pay for itself in the first month.”

### **“I don’t have time.”**

**Short:** “That’s exactly why we build it all for you — so you can start in 14 days without lifting a finger.”  
**Long:** “The beauty of Limitless OS is that you don’t need time to set it up — we do everything for you. You just show up for onboarding, and within 14 days, you have a fully automated business running. It’s about saving you time, not taking more of it.”

### **“I’ve tried systems before and they didn’t work.”**

**Short:** “That’s the difference \- those weren’t built for you, by us. This is DFY and tailored 100% to your business.”  
**Long:** “We hear that a lot. Most coaches fail with other systems because they’re generic templates and you’re left to figure it out yourself. Limitless OS is built for you, customized to your offer, and comes with full onboarding and support. That’s why our clients see results in days, not months.”

### **“I’m not tech savvy.”**

**Short:** “Perfect \- we designed it for non-techies.”  
**Long:** “That’s actually a huge plus. Limitless OS is built for coaches who don’t want to touch tech. We do it all for you, walk you through it on onboarding calls, and give you simple videos so you can make quick updates without getting stuck.”

## **URGENCY & SCARCITY**

**Soft:**

* “We’re currently onboarding 5 coaches this month and spots are filling quickly.”

**Strong:**

* “We only take 10 new clients per month so we can deliver fast \- we’ve got 3 spots left right now.”

* “This month’s onboarding closes \[date\], so if we start now, you’ll be live by \[date\].”
