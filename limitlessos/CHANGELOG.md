## 2025-01-26 - Campaign System Simplification

### Summary
Simplified campaign system to focus on **lead source tracking** rather than complex campaign management. Removed expiration dates, usage limits, and related complexity.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **DATABASE_SCHEMA.md**

#### Owners Table - Removed:
- `default_campaign_duration_days` field

- `expires_at` field (expiration dates)
- `idx_campaigns_expires_at` index

#### Campaigns Table - Added:
- `platform` field (optional: "instagram", "facebook", "youtube", etc.)

**Rationale:** Campaigns are now simple tracking codes embedded in URLs. No need for expiration or usage limits.

#### Maintenance Scripts - Removed:
- Expired campaign cleanup script

## What Campaigns Are Now

**Before:** Complex campaign management with expiration, usage limits, lifecycle states
**After:** Simple tracking codes embedded in URLs

### Purpose:
- Track which Instagram post/story/ad drove a lead
- Analytics per campaign (clicks, conversations, conversions)
- Simple on/off switch (active/inactive)

### Example Flow:
1. Owner creates campaign: `FIT2025`
2. Embeds in URL: `limitlessos.com/chat/FIT2025`
3. Shares on Instagram
4. Tracks which leads came from that post
5. Can deactivate campaign when done (optional)

### What's NOT Included:
- ❌ Expiration dates
- ❌ Usage limits (max clicks/conversions)
- ❌ Complex lifecycle states (draft, paused, expired, completed)
- ❌ Campaign duration settings
- ❌ Max active campaigns per owner

---

## Rationale

### Why Remove Expiration/Limits?

1. **Out of Scope for MVP**
   - Focus is on sales conversations, not campaign management
   - Can add later if needed for monetization

2. **Simplifies Implementation**
   - No cron jobs to expire campaigns
   - No usage tracking/enforcement
   - Fewer edge cases to handle

3. **Matches Use Case**
   - Owner just wants to track: "Which post drove this lead?"
   - Don't need: "Limit this campaign to 50 uses"
   - Don't need: "Expire this campaign on Feb 28"

4. **Easier to Understand**
   - Campaign = Tracking code in URL
   - Active = Accepting leads
   - Inactive = Not accepting leads

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Implementations:

If you already built with expiration/limits:

1. **Database Migration:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE owners DROP COLUMN default_campaign_duration_days;
   ALTER TABLE owners DROP COLUMN max_active_campaigns;
   ALTER TABLE campaigns DROP COLUMN max_uses;
   ALTER TABLE campaigns DROP COLUMN expires_at;
   ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN platform TEXT;
   DROP INDEX idx_campaigns_expires_at;
   ```

2. **Remove Validation Logic:**
   - Remove expiration checks
   - Remove usage limit checks
   - Keep only: exists + is_active

3. **Update Error Handling:**
   - Replace `CAMPAIGN_EXPIRED` with `CAMPAIGN_INACTIVE`
   - Remove `CAMPAIGN_LIMIT_REACHED`

---

## Future Considerations

### If You Need Expiration/Limits Later:

You can add them back when needed for:
- **Pricing tiers** (Free: 1 campaign, Pro: 10 campaigns)
- **Time-limited promotions** (Black Friday sale)
- **Usage-based billing** (Pay per lead)

But for MVP: **Keep it simple. Just track lead sources.**
