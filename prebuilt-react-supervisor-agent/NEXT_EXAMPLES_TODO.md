## 💡 Advanced Ideas (After Basics)

Once you've built one of the above, we can add:

### **Combine with Persistence:**
```python
# Add SQLite checkpointing to any example
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver

checkpointer = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string("support.db")
supervisor = create_supervisor(...).compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# Now conversations resume across sessions!
```

### **Add Human-in-the-Loop:**
```python
# Pause for human approval before critical actions
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def billing_agent_node(state):
    if refund_amount > 100:
        approval = interrupt({"question": "Approve $100+ refund?"})
        if not approval:
            return {"messages": ["Refund denied by human"]}
    # Process refund...
```

### **Add Multi-Session Memory:**
```python
# Remember customer history across conversations
class CustomerState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    customer_id: str
    previous_issues: list[str]  # Persisted!
    satisfaction_score: float   # Persisted!
```
