# 📊 Research Results Directory

This directory contains automatically generated research reports from the multi-agent collaboration system.

## 📁 File Naming Convention

Files are named using the following pattern:
```
research_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<unique_id>.md
```

**Example:**
```
research_results_20251023_023301_e70c25c5.md
```

Where:
- `YYYYMMDD` - Date (e.g., 20251023 = October 23, 2025)
- `HHMMSS` - Time (e.g., 023301 = 2:33:01 AM)
- `unique_id` - 8-character UUID for uniqueness (e.g., e70c25c5)

## 📄 File Structure

### 1. **Header Metadata**
- Generation timestamp

### 2. **Final Report**

## 🔍 How Results Are Generated

1. **User Query** → Research Agent searches the web
2. **Web Results** → Analysis Agent synthesizes findings
3. **Analysis** → Report Agent creates final report
4. **Report** → **Automatically saved to this directory**

## 💡 Usage Tips

### View Latest Report
```bash
ls -lt results/ | head -2
```

### Search Reports by Query
```bash
grep -l "your search term" results/*.md
```

### Count Total Reports
```bash
ls -1 results/*.md | wc -l
```

### View Report in Terminal
```bash
cat results/research_results_*.md | less
```

## 🗑️ Cleanup

To remove old reports:
```bash
# Remove reports older than 7 days
find results/ -name "*.md" -mtime +7 -delete

# Remove all reports (keep README)
rm results/research_results_*.md
```

## 📊 File Size

Typical report sizes:
- **Small query:** 2-5 KB
- **Medium query:** 5-10 KB  
- **Large query:** 10-20 KB
