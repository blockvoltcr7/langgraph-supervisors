| **Clarification** | 3 tests | Vague/ambiguous requests |
| **Edge Cases** | 3 tests | Multiple issues, ambiguous routing |
| **Total** | **17 tests** | All routing paths covered |

## Tools Coverage

| Tool | Test Cases Using It |
|------|-------------------|

## Expected Success Criteria

For each test to pass:
1. ‚úÖ Correct routing (coordinator sends to right team)
2. ‚úÖ Appropriate tools used
3. ‚úÖ Response contains expected keywords
4. ‚úÖ No errors during execution

## Running Specific Tests

To test specific scenarios manually:

```python
from test_scenarios import TEST_SCENARIOS, run_test_scenario
from main import create_coordinator_graph

graph = create_coordinator_graph()

# Run test 1 (API error)
run_test_scenario(graph, TEST_SCENARIOS[0], verbose=True)

# Run test 6 (refund request)
run_test_scenario(graph, TEST_SCENARIOS[5], verbose=True)
```

## Interpreting Results

**‚úÖ PASSED** - Test behaved as expected:
- Routed to correct team
- Used appropriate tools
- Response contained expected information

**‚ùå FAILED** - Test did not meet expectations:
- Wrong routing
- Missing tool usage
- Response missing key information

## Notes

- Tests use simulated tools (no real API calls)
- Each test runs in isolated thread (different thread_id)
- LLM responses may vary slightly but should follow expected patterns
- Some tests may show deprecation warnings (safe to ignore)
