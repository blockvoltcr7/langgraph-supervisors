## 🚀 Quick Start: Human-in-the-Loop

Since this is the #1 recommendation, here's how to add it to your system TODAY:

```python
# In main.py, add to billing tools:

from langgraph.types import interrupt

@tool
def process_refund_with_approval(invoice_id: str, amount: float, reason: str) -> str:
    """Process a refund with human approval."""
    
    # Pause and ask human
    approved = interrupt(
        f"💰 APPROVAL NEEDED:\n"
        f"Invoice: {invoice_id}\n"
        f"Amount: ${amount:.2f}\n"
        f"Reason: {reason}\n\n"
        f"Approve this refund? (yes/no)"
    )
    
    if approved and approved.lower() == "yes":
        return process_refund(invoice_id, amount, reason)
    else:
        return f"❌ Refund denied by human operator"
```

**That's it!** Now refunds require human approval.
