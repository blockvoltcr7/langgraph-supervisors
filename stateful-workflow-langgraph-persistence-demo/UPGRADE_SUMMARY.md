### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Updated all dependencies to v1
2. ✅ `main.py` - Updated docstring for v1
3. ✅ `MIGRATION_TO_V1.md` - Created migration guide

### Dependencies Upgraded:
```diff
- langgraph>=0.2.58
+ langgraph>=1.0.1                       # LangGraph v1

- langchain-openai>=0.3.0
- langchain-core>=0.3.64
+ langchain>=1.0.0                       # LangChain v1
+ langchain-core>=1.0.0,<2.0.0           # Core components
+ langchain-openai>=1.0.1                # OpenAI integration

- langgraph-cli[inmem]>=0.1.0
+ langgraph-cli[inmem]>=0.4.4            # LangGraph Studio support
```

## ✅ Test Results

### Main Script (`main.py`):
```bash
$ uv run python main.py
✅ SUCCESS - Stateful workflow working perfectly
   - Planning Stage: ✅ Completed
   - Execution Stage: ✅ Completed (multiple iterations)
   - Review Stage: ✅ Completed
   - Persistence: ✅ SQLite checkpoints working
   - Thread Management: ✅ project-1 created
```

**Output:**
```
✅ LangSmith tracing enabled
   Project: langgraph-supervisor-demo
💾 Using SQLite database: project_checkpoints.db

🚀 Starting new project: AI Agent Platform
📝 Thread ID: project-1

✓ PLANNING stage completed
✓ EXECUTION stage completed (5 iterations)
✓ REVIEW stage completed
✅ Project workflow complete!
```

## 🏗️ Architecture (Unchanged)

The stateful workflow pattern remains the same:

```
User Input
    ↓
Planning Node
    ↓ (checkpoint saved)
Execution Node (loop until done)
    ↓ (checkpoint saved)
Review Node
    ↓ (checkpoint saved)
Complete
```

### Key Features:
1. **SQLite Persistence** - State saved to `project_checkpoints.db`
2. **Thread-based Sessions** - Each project gets unique thread ID
3. **Checkpointing** - State saved after every node
4. **Resume Capability** - Can pause and resume workflows
5. **Time Travel** - Can go back to previous checkpoints

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the Demo:
```bash
cd /Users/samisabir-idrissi/dev/langgraph/supervisor-examples/stateful-workflow-langgraph-persistence-demo

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the demo
uv run python main.py
```

### Use LangGraph Studio:
```bash
# Start the server
uv run langgraph dev

# Access Studio
https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
```

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. **Persistence Pattern**
```python
# SQLite checkpointer
checkpointer = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string("project_checkpoints.db")

# Compile with persistence
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# Thread-based execution
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "project-1"}}
result = app.invoke(state, config)
```

### 2. **State Management**
```python
class ProjectState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    project_name: str
    current_stage: Literal["planning", "execution", "review", "complete"]
    tasks: list[dict]
    completed_tasks: list[dict]
    review_notes: str
```

### 3. **Workflow Stages**
- **Planning**: Define project goals and tasks
- **Execution**: Complete tasks iteratively
- **Review**: Evaluate completed work
- **Complete**: Finalize project

### 4. **Advanced Features**
- ✅ Resume workflows across sessions
- ✅ Time-travel to previous states
- ✅ Interruption handling
- ✅ Checkpoint history inspection
- ✅ LangSmith tracing

## 🎓 Benefits of v1

1. **Stability**: Production-ready APIs with long-term support
2. **Performance**: Optimized execution and checkpointing
3. **Compatibility**: Seamless integration with LangChain v1 ecosystem
4. **Enhanced Studio**: Better visualization and debugging
5. **Future-proof**: Built for long-term maintenance

## 📚 What Stayed the Same

✅ **No Breaking Changes:**
- All imports were already compatible
- No `create_react_agent` usage to migrate
- Persistence patterns unchanged
- State management identical
- Workflow logic the same

✅ **Already Using Best Practices:**
- `SqliteSaver` for persistence
- Thread-based execution
- Proper state schema
- Checkpointing at every step
- Error handling

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env`):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key_here
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=langgraph-supervisor-demo
```

### Database Options:
- **In-memory**: `:memory:` (for testing)
- **File-based**: `project_checkpoints.db` (default)
- **Custom**: Any SQLite connection string

## 🎨 LangGraph Studio Integration

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "project_workflow": "./main.py:app"
  },
  "env": ".env"
}
```

**Studio Features:**
- Visual workflow representation
- Interactive testing with persistence
- State inspection at checkpoints
- Resume workflows from UI
- Time-travel debugging

## 📖 Example Usage

### Start a Project:
```python
from main import create_project_workflow

app = create_project_workflow()
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "my-project"}}

result = app.invoke({
    "messages": [("user", "Create a mobile app for task management")]
}, config)
```

### Resume Later:
```python
# Resume from where left off
resumed = app.invoke(None, config)
```

### View History:
```python
# Get checkpoint history
history = list(app.get_state_history(config))
for checkpoint in history:
    print(f"Stage: {checkpoint.values['current_stage']}")
```
